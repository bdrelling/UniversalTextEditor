# UniversalTextEditor

**UniversalTextEditor** is intended to be an extendable, universal text editor for iOS and macOS, compatible with UIKit, AppKit, and SwiftUI. Surprisingly enough, there just don't seem to be many good ones out there these days.

## Roadmap

The following items are planned, in somewhat priority order:

- [x] Bold
- [x] Italics
- [x] Underline
- [ ] Strikethrough
- [ ] Superscript / Subscript
- [ ] Headings (1-6?)
- [ ] Markdown Support
- [ ] macOS Hover Menu
- [ ] macOS Menu command support
- [ ] iOS Menu and Toolbar toggling
- [ ] iOS Bluetooth Keyboard Support
- [ ] Plain Text / Rich Text Mode Toggling
